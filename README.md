### What is SPCTRL?
SPCTRL is a simple web application that allows users to generate customized ambient soundscapes and tailor the audio to accentuate their mood. SPCTRL was created to offer users more personalization by providing the ability to manipulate the sound composition once it has been created. This application can be used by first composing your initial composition and adjusting the sliders to establish the optimal sound environment.
